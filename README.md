## Space Invaders-style Game in Assembly

This project is a simple Space Invaders-style game developed in assembly language. The game simulates a squid defending the seas by collecting energy and destroying the bad guys.

## How to Play

- Use the left and right arrow keys to move the rover.
- Press the spacebar to fire a missile to destroy enemy ships.
- Avoid collisions with enemy ships to prevent energy loss.
- Collect energy from good meteors to increase your rover's energy level.
- The game ends when an enemy ship collides with the rover or when the energy level reaches zero.
- You can pause, resume, or restart the game at any time.
